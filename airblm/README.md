## Mission Statement
AirBLM seeks to catalyze change for the BLM movement through iterative Airtable workflows that allow for the dissemination of clear, reliable, up-to-date, and validated information by providing and listing alternative strategies people can engage upon to take action and stay educated.

## Journey

We built this web app as part of [Essteem](https://www.essteem.com/)'s Equalithon for Justice for Black Lives.

**Equalithon Challenge**:
How do we enable people at risk of COVID-19 or unable to protest in person to support the movement through tech?

***Problem***: Everyday, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other mainstream (old and new) media sources are populated with links, story posts, and other sources of information, contributing to an infodemic for the general public on what is currently happening with the Black Lives Matter movement. There are collections of spreadsheets and documents out there, but oftentimes they are outdated and not regularly updated to ensure all of the information on them is relevant and accurate to the current situations evolving in the US. There are also no clear data validation methods used to ensure the data on these resources is credible and informative.

***Solution***: We intend to solve this problem through iterative, Airtable workflows with clearly defined automation and data validation methods to ensure the information we present helps catalyze people to take action. Our information will be aggregated on our website, allowing for ease of access to all of the data we collect on Airtable.

#### MVP

We created a website that makes all of our data accessible in one place while utilizing Airtable as our database in order to involve non-developers to contribute to our project currently and in the future.

***Technologies used***: ReactJS, Material UI, and Airtable API

#### Future Iterations


***Automation***: data collection and validation via Python scripts and/or other existing web scraping/automation tools.

***Social***: gamifying the platform and incentivizing users to get involved in a fun and meaningful way.

***Growth Model***: implementing a national to state to city growth model, starting with a core team and a core Airtable workflow.This will allow people to get involved both at participating in the BLM movement at a local level as well as contributing to data collection of new resources.

***Tools***: automated email template generation tool for users to get in touch with relevant officials.
